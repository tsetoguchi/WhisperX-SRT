00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:15,539
Dance with me under the diamonds See me like breath in the cold Sleep with me here in the silence

2
00:01:52,790 --> 00:02:20,296
If it's not you, it's not anyone Looking back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done If it's not you, it's not anyone

00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:27,569
If it's not you, it's not anyone

4
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,437
If it's not you, it's not anyone
